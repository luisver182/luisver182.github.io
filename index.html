		<p><strong><h2>My Learning Experience in Python and HTML</h2></strong></p>
		<p>At the beginning of this online course, learning Python and HTML felt easy and even exciting. The first lessons were simple to follow, and I felt motivated to dive deeper into programming.</p>
		<p>However, as the weeks went by, the course became much more difficult and intensive. Some topics were very complex, and learning to code while studying online was sometimes challenging. It required a lot of focus, practice, and patience.</p>
		<p>Despite the difficulties, I learned so much. I can now write basic programs in Python, understand loops, conditionals, and functions. I also gained the ability to structure a webpage using HTML. These are skills I never thought I would have, and I’m proud of the progress I made.</p>
		<p>One of the biggest reasons I was able to succeed in this course was because of our amazing teacher, <span class="highlight">Ms. Brittany Smith</span>. Even though the classes were online, she made the experience feel very engaging and supportive. Her way of explaining things was always clear, friendly, and easy to understand. She had a special way of making us feel confident, even when the material got tough. I truly appreciate her patience and dedication.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, this online class was both challenging and rewarding. I’ve grown a lot, not just as a student, but also in my confidence with technology. I am sincerely thankful to <span class="highlight">Ms. Brittany Smith</span> for her excellent teaching and the passion she shared with all of us.</p>
